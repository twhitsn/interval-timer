## Interval Timer

I got tired of trying to find a decent interval timer online, so I made one. The idea is to have something simple and lightweight that I can use for workouts. I also implemented a [cards workout](https://www.verywellfit.com/how-to-use-playing-cards-to-create-a-workout-routine-85990) generator, which creates a new interval for each card.

This is all still a work in progress.

## To-do

- [ ] finish interval and card forms
- [ ] highlight current interval
- [ ] animated timer bar
- [ ] support permalink

## Fix

- [ ] breaks when pausing if at 00:00
- [ ] clear not working properly (timer still persists)
